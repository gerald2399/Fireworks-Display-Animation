## Description:
This is an Independence Day landing page I built and created with a fireworks animation and a Mt. Rushmore image in the background. I used GIMP to cut out Mt. Rushmore from an image using GIMP and placed it in the background using CSS and HTML. I used Javascript, and the Javascript framework Fireworks.js. for the animation of the fireworks on the landing page.
